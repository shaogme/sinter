# Hello Sinter

Welcome to **Sinter**, a high-performance content compilation system built with Rust.

## Why Sinter?

1. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with shared Rust structs.
2. **Speed**: Parallel compilation using Rayon.
3. **Simplicity**: Markdown in, JSON out.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Sinter!");
}
```

Enjoy your stay!
